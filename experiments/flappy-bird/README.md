# Flappy bird
Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company dotGEARS. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)).

## About this Project
This is a remake of the original flappy bird game.
I have used the [Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) and the [Neuroevolution Library](https://github.com/digitsensitive/neuroevolution-typescript)
in Typescript for the machine learning.
