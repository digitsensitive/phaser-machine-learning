# Neuroevolution library in Typescript

## Neuroevolution

Neuroevolution, or neuro-evolution, is a form of machine learning that uses evolutionary algorithms to train artificial neural networks. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, computer games, and evolutionary robotics. A main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a network's performance at a task. For example, the outcome of a game (i.e. whether one player won or lost) can be easily measured without providing labeled examples of desired strategies.

## Motivation

This library has been greatly influenced by [xviniette](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning).
My motivation was to rewrite it in TypeScript.

## Usage

`import * as Neuroevolution from './node_modules/neuroevolution-typescript/main';`

## Version

0.0.1 (work in progress)
