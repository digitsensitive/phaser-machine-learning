# Phaser and Machine Learning
Experiments with Phaser and Machine Learning.
As boilerplate of the experiments I have used this [repository](https://github.com/digitsensitive/phaser-ts-webpack-boilerplate).

## How to use
To start an experiment do the following simple steps in the accordingly folder using your console:

1. `npm install` to install node_modules
2. `webpack` to build bundle.js
3. `webpack-dev-server` to start server
4. `localhost:8080` to start the experiment in your browser.
